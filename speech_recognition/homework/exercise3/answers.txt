Question 1

The number of <s> is 3 but it's being ignored because it is always assumed in the beginning of the sentence.

Likelihood estimates P( in ) = 0.136
Likelihood estimates P( a ) = 0.045
Likelihood estimates P( </s> ) = 0.045



Question 2

bigrams:
Likelihood estimates P( the|is ) = 0.25
Likelihood estimates P( box|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( is|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( in|is ) = 0.666
Likelihood estimates P( bag|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( </s>|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( it|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( a|is ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( on|is ) = 0


trigrams:
Likelihood estimates P( the|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( box|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( is|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( in|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( bag|in the ) = 0.5
Likelihood estimates P( </s>|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( it|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( a|in the ) = 0
Likelihood estimates P( on|in the ) = 0


Question 3

Using the interpolated absolute discounting, I got the following results:
P( in | is ) = 0.545
P( </s> | is ) = 0.045

Using the command 'ngram -lm 2gram.lm -ppl test.txt -debug 2' we can see that the values computed by hand match the probabilities computed with the above command.


Question 4

a) The log probability for the first sentence is: -3.35094
The log probability for the second sentence is: -2.83334
The log probability for the third sentence is: -2.51316

b) According to the model, the third sentence is the most probable with log probability of -2.51316

c) An example sentence: "the box", with probability of: -1.39936


Question 5

a) 1-gram model has probability of -264042
   2-gram model has probability of -237930
   3-gram model has probability of -235817

   The 3-gram model gave the best probability for the data.

b) The proportion of out-of-vocabulary data is: 27097


Question 6

a) 1-gram morph model has probability of: -662489
   2-gram morph model has probability of: -503229
   3-gram morph model has probability of: -465729

   The 3-gram morph model gave the best probability for the morph data.

b) The proportion of out-of-vocabulary morph data is: 0
