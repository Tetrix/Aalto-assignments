Question 1

a) The second lexicon 'w150.dict' contains only the words that appear in the
evaluation set so, when we try to predict the evaluation set, the model has
already seen those words and that is why is predicts them better than the 
other dictionary where it has a lot more words. 

b) The loop allows multiple words to be recognized from a single utterance,
which means that the recognized word will have additional words after it.
By removing the loop, we eliminated those additional words and improved the
accuracy.

Question 2

b) Furthe iterations would not improve the recognition results because from the curse we can see that until hmm - 5, the error drops but on hmm - 6 it increases. So, if we use more iterations, the word-error rate would probably increase.

Question 3

a) The word-error rate for the female subset is 15.93
   The word-error rate for the male subset is 10.33
   The combined word-error rate is 12.98

b) When I used male model with female set, I got word-error rate of 30.86
   When I used female model with male set, I got word-error rate of 40.67
   The combined word-error rate for the mixed models is 36.03

   Most parametric representations of speech are highly speaker dependent and probability distributions suitable for one gender gender may not perform as well for the other gender.

c) # number of gaussians
# males
hmm-6 = 758
hmm-5 = 533
hmm-4 = 383
hmm-3 = 261
hmm-2 = 133

# females
hmm-6 = 305
hmm-5 = 288
hmm-4 = 267
hmm-3 = 224
hmm-2 = 133

# gender independent
hmm-6 = 1058
hmm-5 = 658
hmm-4 = 425
hmm-3 = 266
hmm-2 = 133
